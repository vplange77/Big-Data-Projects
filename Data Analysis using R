## Zillow Home Data Analysis

As vast amounts of data are accumulated each day from various sources, it is important to have the right tools to help extract meaningful insights from the data.
Incoming data has the ability to change predicted outcomes so copious amounts of time has to be allocated towards the cleaning and mining of such data in an effort to show valid outputs.
Zillow is a real-estate database company that provides consumers with data on home prices and values based on information on homes aggregated and analyzed within their database. 
The data reports on home and rental values, home and rental listings, sales, forecasts, mortgage rates amongst other metrics. 

A data set on annual house pricing index was obtained which provided information on Zillow scores according to city and its corresponding states, as well as information on the value over a 5 and 10year period.
It also showed information on the peak times in which the z scores were affected as well as the peak quarters and the highest point to which a Zillow value reached per region. 
Upon assessing this data, the analysis was specified by state because deeper insights could be derived if analyzed per region. 
New York was chosen as the focal point and the data filtered using pivot tables in excel to show the 5 boroughs or counties within NYC, namely Bronx, Queens, Richmond, New York and Kings. 
The cleaned data was loaded into R and loaded several packages such as “ggplot” and “ggrepel” to help us visualize the data. 
Our first analysis was to determine the value of homes within the 5 boroughs of New York. 
As seen in Fig 1.3 below, the x axis shows the different boroughs and the y values shows the different z scores per region.

The z score here represents the various Zillow home value index (Zhvi)- the average estimated home value in a region (Zillow Research, 2018).
From the analysis, it can be observed that the data points(dark circles shown on the line vertically) are closer together in Richmond as well as Queens but are spread out in New York and Bronx, with the presence of outliers. 
Unfortunately, the data doesn’t provide additional insight to conclude what the reason for the outliers were.
From this data we can infer that if a person wanted to live in a region where people’s home values were the same, for example my neighbor’s home or all homes on my street were valued at $500, 000,00 the same as mine, they would have to be in Queens or Richmond. 
However, if a buyer didn’t want to be within such an area and perhaps, wanted their home to be the most valued or expensive within the area, they could look within regions like New York and Bronx. 
We also wanted to observe was the distribution frequency in the 5 boroughs within New York. 

 

	As seen in Fig.2.1, the Zillow scores are spread out across the different boroughs. Unfortunately, we were unable to show this over a time period. However, it is evident through the distribution graph, that the higher the bar, the more values there are that fall within the average range of zestimate scores or zhvi.
	
	
Just like housing data, there are various data sets out there that are accumulated from different locations and it is important to not only clean the data but filter it using different tools such as pivot table or SQL to aggregate the important data to analyze.
